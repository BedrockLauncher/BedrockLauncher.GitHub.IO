            <p>We are only a small team of 2 people, and it is hard for us to translate a whole launcher. That's why, we are asking for you help! Visit our <a href="https://github.com/BedrockLauncher/BedrockLauncher">repository</a> and create a fork with your translations.</p>

            <summary>Why is windows protector blocking the installer?</summary>
            <p>This application is very new, and Windows Defender isn't sure about us yet. As more people use our launcher, Windows will stop prompting people as it will recognize us as not a threat.</p>
